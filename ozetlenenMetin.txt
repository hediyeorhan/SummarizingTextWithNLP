Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. The adjective "deep" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. ANNs have various differences from biological brains.
