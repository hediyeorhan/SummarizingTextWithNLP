Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than 2. Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality. Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms. The SRI deep neural network was then deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning.
